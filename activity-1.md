# **API's and SDK**

## **API Types**

> ### **Internal API**

Internal APIs are designed to be hidden from external users. They are used within the company to share resources. They allow different teams or departments of the business to consume each other's tools, data, and software. The use of internal APIs has many advantages over traditional integration technologies, including security and access control, a system access audit path, and a standard interface for connecting multiple services.

> ### **Partner API**

Partner application programming interfaces are technically similar to open application programming interfaces but have restricted access, often controlled through an external application programming interface portal. They are usually intended for a particular purpose, such as providing access to a paid service. This is a very common pattern in programs as a service ecosystem.

> ### **Rest API**

"Rest" means (representational state transfer), is a very popular network architecture. For such a system to serve as a program of work, it has to adhere to certain architectural constraints or principles, including:

- Client-server architecture: The interface is separated from the back end and data is stored. This allows flexibility and allows the various components to develop independently of each other.

- Stateless:The client context is not stored on the server between requirements.

- Throttleability: Clients can cache responses, so the REST API response must clearly specify whether or not it can be hacked.

- Class system: The API will work whether it connects directly to a server, or through an intermediary such as a load balancer.


> ### **SOAP API**

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a Web application programming interface protocol. It is supposed to be scalable, neutral (capable of operating through a range of communication protocols, including HTTP, SMTP, TCP, and more), and independent (allowing for any programming model). SOAP specifications include:

- Processing model: How to process SOAP message.

- Scalability model: SOAP features and modules.

- Protocol linkage rules: How to use SOAP with a basic protocol, such as HTTP.

- Build message: How to build a SOAP message.

Note that it is possible to create a RESTful application programming interface while using SOAP protocols, although the two are usually considered competition standards.

## **Benefits Of API**

**1. Increases productivity** 

As demand for modern programs continues to rise, companies are looking for quick ways to prototype and create new products. If developers spend their valuable time creating applications from the ground up, when a similar solution is already offered as an application programming interface, it may negatively affect the productivity of your enterprise.

Application programming interfaces offer a powerful mechanism for faster development. Using application programming interfaces, developers can quickly implement current functions instead of creating solutions from the start.

**2. Saves Cost**

The costs of creating an application vary based on several factors, including the complexity of the project, the type of technology used, and the experience of the developers. According to one survey, the development and dissemination of the application cost an average of $270,000.

One of the greatest benefits of application programming interfaces for companies is the ability to save costs. Because application programming interfaces significantly reduce development efforts, using them to create applications is a great way to reduce costs.

Using application programming interfaces, developers can bring most of the jobs they need to create applications from elsewhere - without having to start from scratch. Instead of spending their precious resources and time on reinventing the wheel, they can use cost-effective application programming interfaces from third-party providers or use their own internal application programming interfaces.

**3. Improves connectivity and collaboration**


Private or internal application programming interfaces can improve in-house collaboration and communication. The primary function of application programming interfaces is communication - they enable different systems, applications, and statutes to communicate and share data with each other and implement various types of functions.

As new applications infiltrate organizations at unprecedented rates, they lead to diverse and isolated environments that impede communication and communication. Many institutions end up with broken systems that cannot share data and jobs smoothly.

Application programming interfaces act as a glue that enables unrelated software solutions - such as CRM, marketing automation, and financial services - to stick together and interact easily.

This improved communication and collaboration creates interoperable components that streamline processes and help enterprises to provide the required jobs unhindered.

**4. Creates new revenue opportunities**

Another importance of your enterprise's application programming interface is that it creates new revenue opportunities. By generating income from application programming interfaces, you can detect the value of your digital resources and discover new ways to expand business growth.

If you detect functions via the API, you can charge users (or use the revenue sharing format to pay them) for their consumption. That's what you need to extract gold from your services and data and increase your foundation's profits.

Just like the Internet, which allowed companies to expand their reach beyond traditional sites, application programming interfaces enable modern companies to access new perspectives and convert their digital assets into new income flows.

### **What is the difference between API and SDK?**

There is no simple answer to how SDK and the application programming interface differ since SDK packages usually contain an application programming interface. The real difference is that the application programming interface is really just a service interface, whereas SDK is the tools/components/code parts created for a particular purpose.

Also, when a developer uses SDK to create systems and develop applications, these applications need to connect with other applications. SDK includes an application programming interface to make this connection possible. On the other hand, while the application programming interface can be used to communicate, it cannot create an entirely new application.
